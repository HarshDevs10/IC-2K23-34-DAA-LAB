Unit 01 – Introduction to Algorithms


1. Overview
This unit introduces fundamental algorithms and their implementation in C++. The programs included in this unit demonstrate basic searching and sorting techniques and help in understanding algorithmic problem-solving and complexity analysis.

2. Algorithms Implemented
The following algorithms are implemented in this unit:

Linear Search
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
3. Linear Search
Problem Statement
Given an array of elements and a target value, find the position of the target element using sequential searching.

Algorithm / Approach
Linear Search checks each element of the array one by one until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached.

Pseudocode
LINEAR_SEARCH(array, target)

    FOR i = 0 to n - 1

        IF array[i] == target
            RETURN i

    RETURN -1
Complexity Analysis
Case	Time Complexity
Best Case	O(1)
Average Case	O(n)
Worst Case	O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Sample Input
Array: 10 20 30 40 50
Target: 30
Sample Output
Element found at index: 2
4. Bubble Sort
Problem Statement
Sort the given array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Algorithm / Approach
Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. After every pass, the largest unsorted element moves toward the end of the array.

Pseudocode
BUBBLE_SORT(array)

    FOR i = 0 to n - 2

        FOR j = 0 to n - i - 2

            IF array[j] > array[j + 1]

                SWAP array[j] and array[j + 1]
Complexity Analysis
Case	Time Complexity
Best Case	O(n)
Average Case	O(n²)
Worst Case	O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Sample Input
5 2 8 1 3
Sample Output
1 2 3 5 8
5. Selection Sort
Problem Statement
Sort an array in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.

Algorithm / Approach
Selection Sort repeatedly finds the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of that portion.

Pseudocode
SELECTION_SORT(array)

    FOR i = 0 to n - 2

        minIndex = i

        FOR j = i + 1 to n - 1

            IF array[j] < array[minIndex]
                minIndex = j

        SWAP array[i] and array[minIndex]


Complexity Analysis
Case	Time Complexity
Best Case	O(n²)
Average Case	O(n²)
Worst Case	O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Sample Input
64 25 12 22 11
Sample Output
11 12 22 25 64
6. Insertion Sort
Problem Statement
Sort an array in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

Algorithm / Approach
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time. Each new element is compared with the elements before it and inserted into its correct position.

Pseudocode
INSERTION_SORT(array)

    FOR i = 1 to n - 1

        key = array[i]
        j = i - 1

        WHILE j >= 0 AND array[j] > key

            array[j + 1] = array[j]
            j = j - 1

        array[j + 1] = key
