Unit 02 -- Divide and Conquer

1. Overview

This unit introduces the Divide and Conquer approach and recursive
techniques for solving searching and sorting problems. The programs
included in this unit demonstrate Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort,
and recursive implementations of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.

The unit focuses on breaking a problem into smaller parts, solving those
parts recursively or independently, and combining the results where
required.

2. Algorithms Implemented

The following algorithms are implemented in this unit:

Iterative Binary Search
Recursive Binary Search
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Recursive Bubble Sort
Recursive Insertion Sort

3. Iterative Binary Search

Problem Statement
Given a sorted array and a target value, find the position of the target
element using Binary Search without recursion.

Algorithm / Approach
Binary Search repeatedly divides the search range into two halves. The
middle element is compared with the target. If the target is larger, the
left boundary is moved to the right half; otherwise, the right boundary
is moved to the left half.

Pseudocode

BINARY_SEARCH(array, target)

    left = 0
    right = n - 1

    WHILE left <= right

        mid = left + (right - left) / 2

        IF array[mid] == target
            RETURN mid

        IF array[mid] < target
            left = mid + 1

        ELSE
            right = mid - 1

    RETURN -1


Complexity Analysis

Case           Time Complexity
Best Case      O(1)
Average Case   O(log n)
Worst Case     O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Sample Input
Array: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70
Target: 40

Sample Output
Element found at index: 3

4. Recursive Binary Search

Problem Statement
Given a sorted array and a target value, find the position of the target
element using Binary Search recursively.

Algorithm / Approach
The array is divided into two halves at every recursive call. The middle
element is compared with the target, and only the half that can contain
the target is searched further.

Pseudocode

RECURSIVE_BINARY_SEARCH(array, left, right, target)

    IF left > right
        RETURN -1

    mid = left + (right - left) / 2

    IF array[mid] == target
        RETURN mid

    IF array[mid] < target
        RETURN RECURSIVE_BINARY_SEARCH(array, mid + 1, right, target)

    RETURN RECURSIVE_BINARY_SEARCH(array, left, mid - 1, target)

Complexity Analysis

Case           Time Complexity
Best Case      O(1)
Average Case   O(log n)
Worst Case     O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(log n) due to the recursive call stack.

Sample Input
Array: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70
Target: 40

Sample Output
Element found at index: 3

5. Merge Sort

Problem Statement
Sort the given array in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.

Algorithm / Approach
Merge Sort follows the Divide and Conquer approach. The array is
repeatedly divided into two halves until single-element subarrays are
obtained. The sorted subarrays are then merged to produce the final
sorted array.

Pseudocode

MERGE_SORT(array, left, right)

    IF left >= right
        RETURN

    mid = left + (right - left) / 2

    MERGE_SORT(array, left, mid)
    MERGE_SORT(array, mid + 1, right)

    MERGE(array, left, mid, right)

Complexity Analysis

Case           Time Complexity
Best Case      O(n log n)
Average Case   O(n log n)
Worst Case     O(n log n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

Sample Input
38 27 43 3 9 82 10

Sample Output
3 9 10 27 38 43 82

6. Quick Sort

Problem Statement
Sort the given array in ascending order using the Quick Sort algorithm.

Algorithm / Approach
Quick Sort selects a pivot element and partitions the array so that
elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it and larger elements
are placed after it. The two resulting parts are then sorted
recursively.
The implementation in this unit uses the last element as the pivot.

Pseudocode

QUICK_SORT(array, low, high)

    IF low >= high
        RETURN

    pivotIndex = PARTITION(array, low, high)

    QUICK_SORT(array, low, pivotIndex - 1)
    QUICK_SORT(array, pivotIndex + 1, high)

Complexity Analysis

Case           Time Complexity
Best Case      O(n log n)
Average Case   O(n log n)
Worst Case     O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(log n) on average due to recursion, and O(n) in the
worst case.

Sample Input
10 7 8 9 1 5

Sample Output
1 5 7 8 9 10

7. Recursive Bubble Sort

Problem Statement
Sort an array in ascending order using a recursive version of the Bubble
Sort algorithm.

Algorithm / Approach
One complete Bubble Sort pass moves the largest element of the current
unsorted portion to the end. The algorithm then recursively sorts the
remaining portion of the array.
The implementation also stops early if no swapping occurs during a pass.

Pseudocode

RECURSIVE_BUBBLE_SORT(array, n)

    IF n <= 1
        RETURN

    swapped = false

    FOR i = 0 to n - 2

        IF array[i] > array[i + 1]
            SWAP array[i] and array[i + 1]
            swapped = true

    IF swapped == false
        RETURN

    RECURSIVE_BUBBLE_SORT(array, n - 1)

Complexity Analysis

Case           Time Complexity
Best Case      O(n)
Average Case   O(n²)
Worst Case     O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(n) due to the recursive call stack.

Sample Input
64 34 25 12 22 11 90

Sample Output
11 12 22 25 34 64 90

8. Recursive Insertion Sort

Problem Statement
Sort an array in ascending order using a recursive version of the
Insertion Sort algorithm.

Algorithm / Approach
The algorithm recursively sorts the first n - 1 elements. It then
takes the last element and inserts it into its correct position in the
already sorted portion.

Pseudocode

RECURSIVE_INSERTION_SORT(array, n)

    IF n <= 1
        RETURN

    RECURSIVE_INSERTION_SORT(array, n - 1)

    key = array[n - 1]
    j = n - 2

    WHILE j >= 0 AND array[j] > key

        array[j + 1] = array[j]
        j = j - 1

    array[j + 1] = key

Complexity Analysis

Case           Time Complexity
Best Case      O(n)
Average Case   O(n²)
Worst Case     O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(n) due to the recursive call stack.

Sample Input
12 11 13 5 6

Sample Output
5 6 11 12 13

*Quick Sort uses O(log n) auxiliary stack space on average and can
require O(n) stack space in the worst case.
